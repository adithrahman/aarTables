# aarTables
Another Javascript table. I created this table only for fun. I used it for all my project, so I dont have to used another tables.  
It's look like DataTables, YES!!!

Functionalities:
1. Searchable data field
2. Sort asc/des column
3. Pagination
4. Rows view

Next Funcs:
I'm working to create filter. But, in my opinion If we have sort and search then is filter still important??

Req:
1. Tailwind as Style. Later maybe another CSS framework support
2. jQuery 3.7


Feel free to use my table!
